    improve number of jobs counting


1, Contents
- sub.sh (prun job submit script)
- slim.py (slimming python script)
- datasets (list of input datasets and output datasets)
- mon.sh (script of monitoring panda jobs)
  *psequencer (https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Atlas/PandaSequencer) may be useful (previously, it was not useful for me by many reason...)

2, To do before submitting jobs

-Change datasets file
--format should be 
inputDataset1 outputDataset1
inputDataset2 outputDataset2
.
.

--You have to use name beginning with "user.nickname." for output dataset
  (see https://savannah.cern.ch/forum/forum.php?forum_id=1259)

-Change "username" in function "kin()" in mon.sh



--Changing points are:

-Modify slim.py as you like
--Changing points are:

---Contents In Slimming D3PD defined in:
#*****set brances*****   
to
#*****end set brances*****
----You can choose branches what you want





---Event Selection
----You can see some exapmles of event selection below
#new tree
----default setting save all events

----Below "#----- GoodRunList example", you can change GRL definitions

3, run
- Just run:
./sub.sh

-then the jobs will be submitted
-You can get file "list" which has jobIDs in panda

-mon.sh is monitoring such jobs
-You just have to do:
./mon.sh

-If the job was finished w/o any fails, it will be written in "donelist"
-If the job was finished with some fails, the job will be retried automatically and listed in monitoring list

4, If you got error like:
ERROR : No candidate. Release:Atlas-15.6.10 was not found in ['ANALY_NCG-INGRID-PT']. Could not find sites
you just have to change release in sub.sh (--athenaTag=a.b.c.d) to available release listed in 
http://panda.cern.ch:25980/server/pandamon/query?overview=releaseinfo

This athena release will be used only for the setup of root, then the athena release itself is not so important
